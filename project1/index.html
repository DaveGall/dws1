		<hr />
		<p>There aren't many activities that you can do in this modern age that don't cost money, I try to find all the ones that are free. One I have found that I truly enjoy is hiking. Whenever I go on a hike I like to take my time (not just because I am old) and enjoy the scenery. There are so many different types of plants and trees that you can find.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Madrons</li>
			<li>Pines</li>
			<li>Oak</li>
			<li>Manzanita</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That just names the trees that you will see walking through the hills of the northwest. There are so many different kinds of plants that I wouldn't even know where to start except which one to avoid. That would be the <em>poison oak plant</em>; it is definitely one you want to steer clear of. As long as you wear pants you will be okay though.</p>
		<p>It is good to go at different times of the day and night also, you get to experience different beauties of nature at different times. If you go in the morning you get different colors and smells than you do in the evening or at night. Everything smells fresh and lively in the morning and in the evening it has a dusty worn feel to it. If you stay out long enough you can feel the change at night to the freshness of the early morning.</p>

		<p>I would say one of the best things about going out into the wilderness and hiking is the abundance of wildlife. Not only the abundance but the variety of wildlife that you can see no matter when you go out. It ranges from small to large but you get the full spectrum of animals here. Here are a few animals that you may find out here;</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lizards</li>
			<li>Rabbits</li>
			<li>Snakes</li>
			<li>Deers</li>
			<li>Butterflies</li>
			<li>Birds
				<ul>
					<li>Vultures</li>
					<li>Hawks</li>
					<li>Bald Eagles</li>
					<li>Robins</li>
					<li>Jays</li>
					<li>Chickadees</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Bears</li>
			<li>Bobcats</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It is really amazing as you walk and you see the different parts of wildlife interacting with each other. I think one of my favorite things to do is to watch eagles or osprey dive for fish in the lakes. It always amazes me that they can just pick fish off the top of the water and I can't hook a single fish. I usually stop hiking, fishing or whatever I am doing and take pictures.</p>
		<p>Hiking gives you the freedom to go out and enjoy the natural animals in their natural habitat while that habitat still exists. Yes you do have to be careful of them because it is their territory but as long as you take proper precautions and don't walk up to a bear and give it a huge hug just because it looks cuddly you will be fine. When you are walking don't creep around make sure you are constantly making noise that way the bigger animals are gone by the time you get there. You can also bring some bear mace or a gun along just in the rare event something does happen you can make some noise.</p>
			
		
		<h2 id="water">Glistening Streams and Lakes</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Not only does nature provide us with great scenery and amazing wildlife but it also presents us with great bodies of water. There is nothing like the sound of rushing water as you are hiking or trying to sleep. Not only is it calming but on hot days it is nice and refreshingly cool. You can feel the rapids creating a fresh breeze that calms your soul. The rivers are great for wading, swimming and fishing. In the middle of the day under the hot sun there is nothing like wading into a nice cool creek/river. Of course you need to be careful of the slippery rocks so you don't hurt yourself but other than that it's great.</p>
		<p>Most of the lakes you run into here are man made for irrigation purposes but they are great for boating or fishing. It is nice to just drop a line in during the evening hours when things are starting to quiet down and wait for that tug from a fish. I don't eat fish so I just throw them back unless of course my wife or kids are with me because they enjoy eating them.</p>
		
		<h2 id="supplies">Supplies you Need</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>I know I said that it doesn't cost anything to hike and it really doesn't but there are supplies that you should take. They are obvious but sometimes missed and it can end up being a serious mistake if anything were to happen. So I will give you a list and then explain why each one is important even for that four hour outing.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Snack Food</li>
			<li>Knife</li>
			<li>Backpack</li>
			<li>Whistle</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Matches</li>
			<li>Sunscreen</li>
			<li>Flashlight</li>
			<li>Water</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Okay I know what you are thinking; man this guy has a horrible memory! While that may be true I did mean to put water on there three times.
