			<hr />
			<p>There aren't many activities that you can do in this modern age that don't cost money, I try to find all the ones that are free. One I have found that I truly enjoy is hiking. Whenever I go on a hike I like to take my time (not just because I am old) so I can enjoy the scenery. There are so many different types of plants and trees that you can find. Here are a few types of trees that you may encounter in the hills of <strong>Southern Oregon.</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Madrons</li>
				<li>Pines</li>
				<li>Oak</li>
				<li>Manzanita</li>
			</ul>
			<p>That just names the trees that you will see walking through the hills of the northwest. There are so many different kinds of plants that I wouldn't even know where to start except which one to avoid. That would be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicodendron_diversilobum"><em>poison oak plant</em></a>; it is definitely one you want to steer clear of. As long as you wear pants you will be okay though. Wildflowers of all sorts spot the area also, from orange to purple the variety of colors and types are beautiful. There is actually a wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid"><strong>Orchid</strong></a> growing in the hills of Southern Oregon. It is definitely not abundant but when you see one it is a beautiful sight.</p>
			<p>It is good to go at different times of the day and night also, you get to experience different beauties of nature at different times. If you go in the morning you get different colors and smells than you do in the evening or at night. Everything smells fresh and lively in the morning and in the evening it has a dusty worn feel to it. If you stay out long enough you can feel the change at night to the freshness of the early morning.</p>
		
			<h2 id="wildlife">Amazing Wildlife</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>I would say one of the best things about going out into the wilderness and hiking is the abundance of wildlife. Not only the abundance but the variety of wildlife that you can see no matter when you go out. It ranges from small to large but you get the full spectrum of animals here. Here are a few animals that you may find out here;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Lizards</li>
				<li>Rabbits</li>
				<li>Snakes</li>
				<li>Deers</li>
				<li>Butterflies</li>
				<li>Birds
					<ul>
						<li>Vultures</li>
						<li>Hawks</li>
						<li>Bald Eagles</li>
						<li>Robins</li>
						<li>Jays</li>
						<li>Chickadees</li>
					</ul></li>
				<li>Bears</li>
				<li>Bobcats</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is really amazing as you walk and you see the different parts of wildlife interacting with each other. I think one of my favorite things to do is to watch eagles or osprey dive for fish in the lakes. It always amazes me that they can just pick fish off the top of the water and I can't hook a single fish. I usually stop hiking, fishing or whatever I am doing and take pictures.</p>
			<p>Hiking gives you the freedom to go out and enjoy the natural animals in their natural habitat while that habitat still exists. Yes you do have to be careful of them because it is their territory but as long as you take proper precautions and don't walk up to a bear and give it a huge hug just because it looks cuddly you will be fine. When you are walking don't creep around make sure you are constantly making noise that way the bigger animals are gone by the time you get there. You can also bring some bear mace or a gun along just in the rare event something does happen you can make some noise.</p>
			
		
			<h2 id="water">Glistening Streams and Lakes</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>Not only does nature provide us with great scenery and amazing wildlife but it also presents us with great bodies of water. There is nothing like the sound of rushing water as you are hiking or trying to sleep. Not only is it calming but on hot days it is nice and refreshingly cool. You can feel the rapids creating a fresh breeze that calms your soul. The rivers are great for wading, swimming and fishing. In the middle of the day under the hot sun there is nothing like wading into a nice cool creek/river. Of course you need to be careful of the slippery rocks so you don't hurt yourself but other than that it's great.</p>
			<p>Most of the lakes you run into here are man made for irrigation purposes but they are great for boating or fishing. It is nice to just drop a line in during the evening hours when things are starting to quiet down and wait for that tug from a fish. I don't eat fish so I just throw them back unless of course my wife or kids are with me because they enjoy eating them.</p>

			<h2 id="supplies">Supplies you Need</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>I know I said that it doesn't cost anything to hike and it really doesn't but there are supplies that you should take. They are obvious but sometimes missed and it can end up being a serious mistake if anything were to happen. So I will give you a list and then explain why each one is important even for that four hour outing. Before I give you the list I have to say one of the most important things to do is to let someone know where you are going, your route and about how long you expect to be gone. This gives you an added safety net so to speak (if that person remembers what you told them) from getting lost because you have someone that knows your path and timetable so if you don't show up they know exactly where to look for you. Okay here is the list of things that you should take with you.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Water</li>
					<li>Snack Food</li>
					<li>Knife</li>
					<li>Backpack</li>
					<li>Whistle</li>
					<li>Water</li>
					<li>Matches</li>
					<li>Sunscreen</li>
					<li>Flashlight</li>
					<li>Water</li>	
				</ol>
			<p>Okay I know what you are thinking; man this guy has a horrible memory! While that may be true I did mean to put water on there three times. It is very important to bring enough water with you even when it is not too warm outside. One thing you don't want to do is to get dehydrated when you are miles from resources because that can lead to some problems including heat stroke. So make sure you take enough water for everybody, even Fido. It is also good to take some snack food that is light and nutritious and full of carbs and protein. Trail mix is a good one to take as is fruit and granola bars. Things like that are good to take because you need all the energy you can get and when you get low you have easy snacks you can just pop in your mouth. Now mind you I am not taking about <abbr title="Meals Ready-to-Eat">MRE's</abbr> just some good normal snack foods.</p>
			<p>I just added the backpack even though it is obvious to everybody because you have to have something to carry everything in. The knife, whistle, flashlight and matches are for your safety. You never know what situation you may run into so it is a good idea to be prepared for the basics. Of course you can't prepare for every possible incident, but those four things will keep you safe in almost any situation you encounter. The whistle may sound weird to you but when you are in bear and cougar country you want something that will make a loud noise just in case they don't want to move and the whistle will get them moving. The last item on there that I need to mention is the sunscreen, not a critical issue if you are in the forest but it all depends on where you are deciding to hike so I always have some on me just in case.</p>
			<p>You will also want to make sure you take a <strong>flashlight</strong> if you are going in the evening or night for your safety. Not just for the fact that there are animals out there that you might surprise but also because you want to make sure you can see where you are going. If it is dark and you don't have a flashlight you could end up walking off a <strong>cliff</strong> or just into a tree branch which could hurt and be bad.</p>
